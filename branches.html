 <h1>The Cape County Resort - Cape Town, South Africa </h1>
County Resort is the only luxury Cape Town hotel located within Table Mountain National Park: at the base of precipitous Chapman’s Peak, it is also the only hotel in the city that is right on the beach and offers sublime ocean views, excellent food and authentic, warm service. <br> <br> 

<h3>Facilities</h3>
Fancy a day flopped by the pool? Grab your pool bag from the closet and get settled in; there’s even sunscreen and water to be sourced from the woven bags dotted around the terrace. For those with a little more motivation, there’s Virgin Active gym passes on offer from reception, who are on-hand 24 hours a day - it’s rather like having a brilliant concierge service. <br> <br>

<h3>Food and drink</h3>

The breakfast at County Resort is quite possibly the best start to the day you might ever have. Lavish (go for at least two courses), and also included in your room rate, it's served at any time of day, and if you’re feeling particularly lazy (or are still recovering from a Table Mountain hike),  they’re also happy to bring it to your room. There’s a full bar service, including a cocktail list and wine list, as well as a limited but seasonally based menu. <br> <br>

<h3>Extra-Curricular </h3>

County Resort is ideally placed if you want to hit one of the Table Mountain trails early doors, but make sure you keep an eye on the weather: brisk south-easterly winds often usher in a fog-like blanket, the ‘tablecloth’ that settles along the flat top, and shuts down the cable car that also shuttles people up and down. Sunrise hikes along Lion’s Head, which sits next to Table Mountain with views down the Atlantic Seaboard, are ‘a must’, according to locals.
